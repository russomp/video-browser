# Video Browser

A YouTube clone based on [Stephen Grider's](https://github.com/StephenGrider) [Modern React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) course using [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) as an initial project template.

The video browser leverages React and the YouTube API to create a real video browsing experience that emulates YouTube.
